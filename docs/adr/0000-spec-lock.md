# ADR-0000: Specification Lock and Repository Bootstrap

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We are starting a new project called LLM-Bench, a comprehensive benchmarking platform for Large Language Models. Before any implementation begins, we need to establish a clear specification and project structure that all future development will follow.

The project requires:
- A well-defined architecture that can scale
- Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Structured development process with multiple phases
- Architecture compliance enforcement
- Documentation-first approach

## Decision
We will:
1. Lock the project specification in `docs/spec.md` as the source of truth
2. Establish a monorepo structure with separate packages for backend (FastAPI/Python) and frontend (Next.js/TypeScript)
3. Implement an architecture guard script to enforce structural compliance
4. Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for all significant changes
5. Follow a phased development approach (P-0 through P-8) with clear deliverables

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear project vision and requirements from day one
- Consistent structure across all development phases
- Automated compliance checking prevents architectural drift
- ADR process ensures decisions are documented and traceable
- Phased approach allows for incremental delivery and validation

### Negative
- Specification changes require formal ADR process (intentional friction)
- Initial setup overhead before feature development
- Developers must understand and follow established conventions

### Risks
- Specification may need updates as we learn more (mitigated by ADR process)
- Architecture guard may be too restrictive (can be updated with ADRs)

## Implementation
- Phase 0 creates the initial repository structure
- `scripts/arch_guard.py` will enforce compliance in CI/CD
- All future phases must follow the established patterns
- Changes to spec.md require new ADRs
