# Phase 2 Completion - 2025-06-26

## Overview
Implementation of async model adapters and basic tools for the LLM-Bench project.

## Deliverables
- ✅ Created `backend/adapters/` directory with base ModelAdapter class
- ✅ Implemented OpenAI adapter with async chat and streaming
- ✅ Implemented Anthropic adapter with system message support
- ✅ Implemented DeepSeek adapter (OpenAI-compatible)
- ✅ Implemented Ollama adapter for local models
- ✅ Created `backend/tools/` directory with base Tool class
- ✅ Implemented Tavily web search tool
- ✅ Implemented safe math expression evaluator
- ✅ Added comprehensive unit tests with httpx mocking
- ✅ Updated dependencies to include httpx and pytest
- ✅ Documented architecture decisions in ADR-0002

## Technical Decisions
- Async/await pattern for all API calls
- httpx for modern async HTTP client
- Abstract base classes for extensibility
- AST-based safe math evaluation
- Pydantic models for type safety
- Environment variables for API keys

## Key Features

### Adapters
- **OpenAI**: Full chat and streaming support
- **Anthropic**: Claude API with proper message formatting
- **DeepSeek**: OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **Ollama**: Local model support with custom prompting

### Tools
- **Tavily Search**: Web search with structured results
- **Math Tool**: Safe expression evaluation with whitelisted operations

## Testing
- Unit tests for all adapters and tools
- Mock-based testing to avoid API calls
- Async test support with pytest-asyncio
- Error condition coverage

## Next Phase
Phase 3 will implement the benchmark engine for systematic LLM evaluation.
