# Phase 8: Production Deployment

**Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Branch**: `phase-8/deploy`

## Summary
Implemented production deployment infrastructure with automated CI/CD pipeline, health monitoring, and global distribution.

## Changes

### Frontend Deployment
- **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`):
  - Next.js optimized build settings
  - API URL environment variable
  - Rewrites for backend proxy
  - Security headers (XSS, frame options, content type)
  - Support for preview deployments

### Backend Deployment
- **Fly.io Configuration** (`fly.toml`):
  - Auto-scaling with minimum 1 instance
  - Health check every 15 seconds
  - 512MB memory allocation
  - Global anycast routing
  
- **Dockerfile**:
  - Python 3.11 slim base image
  - Non-root user for security
  - Health check command
  - Port 8080 exposure

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions** (`deploy.yml`):
  - Triggered on main branch push
  - Sequential deployment (frontend â†’ backend)
  - Health endpoint verification
  - Status code and response body validation
  - 30-second wait for service readiness

### Infrastructure Updates
- Added `/health` endpoint at root for Fly.io
- Updated CORS to include production domains
- Added deployment status badge to README
- Production URLs documented

### Architecture Guard
- Validates presence of deployment files
- Ensures README contains production URLs
- Verifies health check in deploy workflow
- Confirms "ok" status verification

## Technical Details

### Production URLs
- Frontend: https://llm-bench.vercel.app
- Backend: https://llm-bench-api.fly.dev

### Required Secrets
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: For Vercel CLI authentication
- `FLY_API_TOKEN`: For Fly.io deployment
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.: Set in respective platforms

### Deployment Flow
1. Push to main triggers workflow
2. Vercel builds and deploys frontend
3. Fly.io builds Docker image and deploys
4. Health checks verify both services
5. Deployment marked successful

## Next Steps
- Monitor production metrics
- Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- Configure custom domains
- Implement backup strategies
- Add performance monitoring
