üèóÔ∏è Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

    1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    Aspect Tested: ability to adapt output to the user‚Äôs level of understanding.
    What we‚Äôre testing: Does the model drop jargon, choose beginner-friendly analogies, and pitch the depth just right for someone new to coding?

    2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶
    Aspect Tested: summarization and information distillation.
    What we‚Äôre testing: Can the model identify essentials, discard filler, and compress the message without distorting the original meaning?

    3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    Aspect Tested: creative generation under word-count and theme constraints.
    What we‚Äôre testing: Can the model invent a coherent, engaging tale, stick to the 100‚Äì150-word limit, and center on the specified theme?

    4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    Aspect Tested: basic numerical and logical reasoning.
    What we‚Äôre testing: Can the model translate the word problem into math, perform the simple calculations, and state the concrete answer clearly?

    5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶
    Aspect Tested: style transfer and tone transformation.
    What we‚Äôre testing: Does the model preserve meaning while elevating vocabulary, syntax, and register to a polished, formal standard?


Evaluation of my system‚Äôs performance

    My system fought hard. I had it answer in the form of a banana-loving pirate, and I tell you what‚Äîit loved those bananas. However, it failed at literally everything else. Nonetheless, once I had rewriting the prompt and removed the tomfoolery, I was able to see a major improvement in the model's answers. Now, I did not go over this in the loom video, as the application was built so that anyone could test their own questions and answer pairs. However, when you do press "load starter kit" to load the sample questions in the test set tab, those 20 questions are based on the evaluation questions. Have fun!

Discussion Question #1:
What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?

    It's all subjective. You're limited in the amount of data you can test.and it's not a repeatable process.My application llm bench attempts to address these shortcommings.
